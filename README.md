MultiTF is a multi-modal representation learning method based on cross-attention networks, which is used to predict transcription factor binding sites.
# Requirements
python                    3.8.10
numpy                     1.22.4   
pandas                    2.0.3 
scikit-learn              1.3.0    
torch                     1.11.0+cu113 
torchvision               0.12.0+cu113  
# Usage

1.Firstly, run pairs.py, and generate the corresponding circRNA structure file in the Datasets folder.

2. run wTest.py, and the results will be saved in the RESULT file "cTest" of  the datasets.

Thank you and enjoy the tool!# MMD-DTI
